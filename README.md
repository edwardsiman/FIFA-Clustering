## Clustering Football Player with Similar Attribute (FIFA 21 Clustering Project)

This project is an unsupervised machine learning application to cluster football players based on its attribute such as defending, shooting,acceleration, marking, etc. This project is inspired from the medium article of 'Grouping Soccer Players with Similar Skillsets in FIFA 20'  (https://towardsdatascience.com/grouping-soccer-players-with-similar-skillsets-in-fifa-20-part-1-k-means-clustering-c4a845db78bc)  with some modifications.

The dataset for this project is provided via Kaggle and it can be found in this link:

The machine learning model applied to this project is K-Means Clustering where a cluster center is placed to reduce the distance as low as possible. 
The required package in this machine learning models are:
- Pandas (v 1.0.4)
- Numpy (v 1.17.2)
- Matplotlib (v 3.1.1)
- Scikit-Learn (v 0.21.3)

Thanks, kindly provide any feedback or suggestion regarding the project
